# Makerspace Program Team

**Dale Dougherty** _Founder_

is the founder and publisher of MAKE magazine and the creator of Maker Faire, which leads a growing maker movement. An early Web pioneer, Dale was the developer of Global Network Navigator (GNN), the first commercial Web site launched in 1993 and sold to America Online in 1995. He coined the term Web 2.0 as part of developing the Web 2.0 Conference. Make Magazine started in 2005 followed by the first Maker Faire in the Bay Area in 2006. In 2010, Maker Faire was held in the Bay Area, Detroit and New York City. He was a Lecturer at the UC Berkeley School of Information from 1997 to 2002. He was named a “Champion of Change” in 2011 by The White House.

**Parker Thomas** _Project Director_

is an entrepreneur and product manager who has started and sold two companies. A passionate maker, he’s built two airplanes and flown them around the country. He’s now concentrating on building two makers named Hana and Kobi and helping them build treehouses, zip lines, decks, play structures, go carts, ponds and anything else they want to build. He is a founding member of the design team for Urban Montessori Charter School, a new charter school in Oakland based on the teachings of Maria Montessori, arts integration and design thinking.

**Stephanie Chang** _Program Developer and Liaison_

spent five years with Galileo Learning as the Director of the Tech Museum Summer Camps, and then earned a master’s degree in the Learning, Design, and Technology (LDT) program at Stanford’s School of Education. She has also worked in other informal science and experiential education settings. In her spare time she is refurbishing a VW bus, and enjoys photography, glassblowing, and galloping around in the sunny hills and waters of the Bay.

**Michelle Hlubinka** _Writer/Designer_

is the Education Director for Maker Media, overseeing educational outreach and programming. Before joining the Maker Faire crew, she worked at the Exploratorium’s Center for Museum Partnerships and MIT Media Lab’s Lifelong Kindergarten group. That work built on previous research at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, as a long- time mentor in the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network, and as a curriculum designer for various publishers and educational researchers. When she’s not supporting future makers, she does some making of her own, most often as a visual artist.

**Devon McGuire** _Events and Community Manager_

tends the website and devises ways to keep the community jumping–both online and in person. Prior to joining our team, she wore a wide variety of hats at TechShop Inc., including Event Coordinator for TechShop San Francisco and Corporate In-Store Event Director, designing many of TechShop’s core events and internal processes along the way. She has a Maker heart and loves finding new ways to make people excited about what they can create with their own two hands. When she’s not on the clock, she enjoys costumed events (and building the costumes to wear to them!), ballroom dancing, drawing, comic books and anything Jim Henson.

**Maker Media**

Maker Media is a global platform for connecting makers with each other, with products and services, and with our partners. Through media, events and ecommerce, Maker Media serves a growing community of makers who bring a DIY mindset to technology. Whether as hobbyists or professionals, makers are creative, resourceful and curious, developing projects that demonstrate how they can interact with the world around them. The launch of MAKE Magazine in 2005, followed by Maker Faire in 2006, jumpstarted a worldwide Maker Movement, which is transforming innovation, culture and education. Located in Sebastopol, CA, Maker Media is the publisher of MAKE Magazine and the producer of Maker Faire. It also develops “getting started” kits and books that are sold in its Maker Shed store as well as in retail channels.
