Best way and time to reach you

In the space below, please tell us about why you’d like to mentor a Young Maker and your experience mentoring, if any.

Are you able to attend Maker Faire on \_\_\_\_\_\_ ? yes / no

Have you ever attended Maker Faire? yes / no If so, which ones?

… and have you ever exhibited at any of those events?

Take a look at the Maker Faire exhibits listed here: **makerfaire.com/search.csp** and name a few that you really like.

What skills can you share with our Makerspace as an “expert” (or at least as someone very experienced)? What areas do you dabble in—that is, you are very interested in them, have some experience doing them, or are really motivated to learn more about them, enough that you can stay ahead of an equally motivated teenager? We’ve included a list of some of the kid-friendly content areas from projects at previous Maker Faires to help you brainstorm. Please be specific when appropriate (for example, if you list “Programming”, you may want to list your favorite languages.)
