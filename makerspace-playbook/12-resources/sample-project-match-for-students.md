1. On the back, please tell us what makes you a Young Maker. You can tell us about your interests or projects you’ve completed, or both. (Use the back!)
2. Are you able to attend Maker Faire on ? yes / no
3. Have you ever attended Maker Faire? yes / no If so, which ones?\
   … and have you ever exhibited at any of those events?
4. Take a look at the Maker Faire exhibits listed here: **makerfaire.com/search.csp** and name some you really like.
5. Some Makerspace start the program with an idea of what they want to make, and others just want to make something, and don’t have a specific idea as they begin. Do you know now what you would like to make over the next several months, which you will then exhibit at Maker Faire? yes / no\
   If yes, please describe it here and SKIP the next question.
6. These are some of the content areas for projects at previous Maker Faires. **Circle** the ones that you wouldn’t mind incorporating in your project. (You may also draw an “X” through anything that you wouldn’t want to do.)

Everybody knows how busy kids and their families can be! About how much time do you hope to spend on your project? (You can estimate per week / per month / total time.)

Check the box in front of the statement that seems the **most** true:

\[ ] I really enjoy working with several other people as part of a team.\
\[ ] I prefer to work on projects by myself.\
\[ ] Sometimes I like to work independently, other times with others. It depends.

Is there anything else you’d like to tell us about yourself or your projects, background or interests? _(Use the back!)_
