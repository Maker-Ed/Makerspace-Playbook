# Sample Proposal and Budget to Submit to a Funder

We propose creating a Makerspace. \[_Describe your own motivations and what the Makerspace will do here_.]

Projects made by typical Makerspaces utilize common tools and supplies in new ways and uncommon ones to build surprising new things. Our Makerspace will need to purchase and acquire tools, a storage shed to keep the tools in, and materials for the students to create their projects. Typically, as a project gets more complex, it tends to become more expensive to build. So greater support from your organization will make more ambitious projects possible.

For example, a grant at the $17,000 level would furnish the Makerspace shop with a laser cutter, which would allow students to create parts for their project out of plastic and wood that are cut very precisely. At the $25,000 level, the Makerspaceâ€™s shop would be fully equipped with a set of tools which would allow students to build in wood, metal, and plastic as well as design parts on a CAD workstation.
