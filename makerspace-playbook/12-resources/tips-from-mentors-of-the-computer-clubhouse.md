# Tips from Mentors of the Computer Clubhouse

**Be yourself.**

Work with kids in a way that is comfortable for you.

**Be reliable.**

Makerspace should know when to count on you coming. Your absence will be noticed!

**Be consistent.**

Be consistent not only in your own attendance but in making sure that you treat all Makerspace fairly and equally.

Although you may find yourself engaged with an individual kid, try not to give the impression that you have a favorite Young Maker. Be open to having others participate. The more consistent you are, the more Makerspace will trust you and start to call on you for help and conversation.

**Be approachable.**

It is important for Makerspace to know that you are available for questions. If you have a chance to work on your own projects, make sure that you are still open to the Makerspace around you. Invite Makerspace to take a look at what you are doing, or ask them for advice on your project. Make sure people know who you are and that you are there to help and to talk.

**Be patient.**

Everyone learns in different ways, yourself included. Be patient with your own learning and with the learning process of others. Sometimes this means stepping in to help, or stepping back to let Makerspace work to solve a problem themselves. Be patient especially when showing someone how to do something that you may know how to do very well. Try not to do it for the Young Maker, unless safety is an issue. Each person will go through a very different learning process and will take different amounts of time to learn something new.

**Participate actively...and avoid lectures.**

You are not here to be a textbook. Engage in your own learning while you are mentoring. Collaborate on projects and experiment.

**Listen.**

As adults we often don’t take the time to really listen to the ideas and thoughts of young people. Take the time; you might find you learn amazing things. Show your interest and excitement, observe, and ask questions.

**Go with the flow.**

Be prepared for the unexpected! Bring ideas for what you would like to do, but be prepared to go with the flow of kids’ changing ideas.

**Get to know kids and let them get to know you.**

Engage a Young Maker in conversation. Ask questions. Offer to share something you know. However, understand that it will take time for the kids to begin to feel comfortable with you.

**Treat all participants with respect.**

Make sure everyone—young and old—feels welcome, important, and a part of the program. Learn names and greet each other by name. Show your interest in their projects—and in their presence. Respect the kids for who they are and where they are developmentally. We all come from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Take the time to get to know everyone individually. Avoid prejudging who they are, their skills, or their cultures.

**Treat kids as individuals, not as a group.**

Each person has different learning and communication styles. Get to know the Makerspace, their interests, and the way in which they feel most comfortable interacting. For some it may be through conversation, others through working on a project or showing you what they are doing.

**Discover and innovate together.**

Don’t be afraid to share your ideas, give advice, and be a resource for creative ideas and new knowledge, opportunities, and possibilities. Show a Young Maker a new tool. Challenge them to try something new, or take on something new yourself. Try saying:

* “Have you tried this?”
* “Do you know about this?”
* “Gee, I don’t know the answer to that question—let’s go find out together.”

**Figure out your own interests.**

Experiment with our resources, work on your own project, and then share your ideas and excitement with Makerspace. One of the best ways to be a role model is to share your own engagement in working with tools, people, and ideas.

**Give off energy.**

Show your excitement about what Makerspace are doing, and your interest in learning from their work. Share your own excitement and engagement in your ideas, and your own work as a Maker.
