You understand your goal is to define a project and work with other Makerspace and mentors to exhibit your completed project (or evidence of what you’ve accomplished to that point) at Maker Faire (dates ). You

agree to use the facilities, tools, and materials in a safe way, and to alert fellow Makerspace, mentors, and/or program leaders when facilities, tools, and materials are being used in a way that could cause harm to themselves or others. You will do your best to come to all meetings. You will provide others with assistance or helpful feedback when you see a way their project could be improved, if such feedback is welcomed. You agree to tell program leaders changes you’d make to the program to improve future workshops. That is: I’ll come. I’ll make something. I’ll help others and stay safe.
